Enter in the creative mind of what it took to build my Magical project!

![](tech-jobs-in-India--1--9.webp)

## *Introduction* {#sec-intro}

Out of all the racial population which of those races have a higher arrest record in murder and drug related offences? 

My prediction is that the African American race has a much higher arrest rate for murder and drug offences than any other race?

The data source that will help me answer my question is [Arrests by Race](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishidamarla/arrests-by-race/data) - which lists out the different types of murders and for each offence the percentage of each race that the crime was committed by is listed.

## *Methods* {#sec-methods}

-   What is the source? The source is from the FBI UCR 

<!-- -->

-   How was the data collected? law enforcement agencies across the United States provide the data to the FBI. The FBI then arranges the reports, sorts and organizes the information and fills missing information with some they have and then publishes both the raw data and trend analyses.   

<!-- -->

-   What are the variables included? 

<!-- -->

-   How many records/rows/participants? 32  

<!-- -->

-   Any other relevant information
